# JAVASCRIPT

The language either you will ðŸ’– it or hate it.

Q. why we need javascript ?

A. html and css is only capable of doing structure and styling of a webpage to make webpage interactive. because it is only language apart of [webassembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts#:~:text=WebAssembly%20is%20a%20new%20type,C%2B%2B%2C%20Rust%2C%20etc.) natively run's on browser.

now the question is that why we can't learn webassembly and get rid of javascript because webassembly is not primarily intended to be written by hand, rather it is designed to be an effective compilation target for source languages like C, C++, Rust, etc.

and other advantage of js(javascript) is that is using js you can do many more things apart from frontend web development.

- backend development using [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
- mobile app development using [reactNative](https://reactnative.dev/)
- build desktop app using [electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- machine learning using [tensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
- provisioning cloud infrastructure using [pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/javascript/)
- game development
  etc..

so now you convinced to learn about js is let's get started with wired javascript history.
